Database

Schema
------

BEdita4 uses `CakePHP Migrations <https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/migrations.html>`_ plugin for schema creation and update.
Schema migration files are located in ``plugins/BEdita/Core/config/Migrations`` and they are basically PHP files that describe
database schema evolution.

With simple shell commands you can check migration status and perform schema update.
See also :ref:`shell:db_admin` shell command to perform schema check and initialization.

A MySQL schema file, provided for convenience only, is available in ``plugins/BEdita/Core/config/schema/be4-schema-mysql.sql``.
It's not used anywhere in BEdita but it may be used as a quick reference.

ER Diagram
----------

A simple ER diagram is displayed here to give you a glimpse of BEdita4 core schema.
Don't use it as a reference though: we will keep an updated version of this diagram, but some tables or fields may still be missing.

Migrations
----------

The recommended way to create a schema migration is to use the ``bake`` shell.

In your terminal, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ bin/cake bake resources_migration MigrationsName

This command will generate two files in your `config/Migrations` folder:

* ``YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_MigrationName.php``: this is the file used as reference in the phinxlog
* ``YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_MigrationName.yml``: this will contain the real content of the migration

Then, you can use the yaml syntax to describe the migration:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # MigrationName migration
  ---

  #create:

  #update:

  #remove:

In the following example, we are going to add a property to the ``profiles`` model, as well as a relation with the ``documents`` model:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # AddAuthorStuff migration
  ---

  create:
    properties:
      - name: pen_name
        object: profiles
        property: text
    relations:
      - name: author_of
        label: Author of
        inverse_name: authored_by
        inverse_label: Authored by
        description: Author relation
        left:
          - profiles
        right:
          - documents
